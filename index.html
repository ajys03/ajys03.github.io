                        During my internship at UMICH ITS, I helped develop the “Firewall Manager”: a software-driven firewall configuration tool. 
                        Through developing the "Firewall Manager", I learnt to utilize numerous applications, frameworks, and libraries, 
                        including but not limited to VMware NSX, Cisco CSM, Python-based FastAPI, SQLModel, and Poetry. It was a very fufilling 
                        experience.

                    <p>
                        As the software engineer for DOGU, an autonomous security vehicle manufacturer, I worked on DOGU's Patrover. 
                        During my work, I drafted a report on the potential integration of ROS2 into DOGU’s ROS1 autonomous vehicle, 
                        assembled Autoware on Ubuntu 20.04.2, and generated 3D visualizations of Patrover with its immediate surroundings in Rviz.
                        The experience opened my eyes to the field of robotics and computer vision, which I still hold an interest in.

                    <p>
                        We first began reading and analyzing multiple research papers on the topic of identity matching with machine learning.
                        After 3 weeks of research, we came across the Hierarchical Naive Bayes (HNB) model: an improved version of the Naïve Bayes 
                        classifier. As a data analyst, in order to replicate the HNB model, 
                        I conducted EDA on ~600,000 records using Python, preprocessed ~600,000 records in accordance with data privary regulations, 
                        and helped build the unsupervised model. Overall, it was an amazing experience which allowed me to dip my toes into machine 
                        learning.
