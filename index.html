                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Yoon Sung (Alexander) Ji, and I am currently a Junior 
                    studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan. <br> <br>
                    Within computer science, I enjoy various topics ranging from AI to software systems. 
                    Currently, I hope to further my interests in network security. I am currently working
                    on the project <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1928">SOCKS Protocol Version 5</a>. <br> <br>
                    Outside of computer science, I enjoy playing/watching soccer, reading self-help or 
                    productivity books, and cooking delicious food. 
                </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>During my internship at UMICH ITS, I helped develop the “Firewall Manager”: a
                            software-driven firewall configuration tool. Through developing the "Firewall Manager",
                            I learnt to utilize numerous applications, frameworks, and libraries, including but 
                            not limited to VMware NSX, Cisco CSM, Python-based FastAPI, SQLModel, and Poetry. It was a
                            very fufilling experience.

                            As the software engineer for DOGU, an autonomous security vehicle manufacturer, I worked
                            on DOGU's Patrover. During my work, I drafted a report on the potential integration of ROS2
                            into DOGU’s ROS1 autonomous vehicle, assembled Autoware on Ubuntu 20.04.2, and generated 3D 
                            visualizations of Patrover with its immediate surroundings in Rviz. The experience opened
                            my eyes to the field of robotics and computer vision, which I still hold an interest in.

                    <ul>
                        <li>During my internship at the University of Michigan ITS, I took part in project
                            IMUML. The purpose of the project was to evaluate and recommend
                            the most appropriate AI development framework to match identities. 
                            We first began reading and analyzing multiple research papers on the topic of 
                            identity matching with machine learning. After 3 weeks of research, we came across the 
                            Hierarchical Naive Bayes (HNB) model: an improved version of the Naïve Bayes classifier. 
                            As a data analyst, in order to replicate the HNB model, I conducted EDA on ~600,000 records using Python, 
                            preprocessed ~600,000 records in accordance with data privary regulations, and helped build the unsupervised model.
                            Overall, it was an amazing experience which allowed me to dip my toes into machine learning.
